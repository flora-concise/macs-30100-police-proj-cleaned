They said 'Drop it, drop it!' loud, and he doesn't, so then we heard two shots, and he falls back into the doorway,""",Pending investigation/No Known Charges,No Known Charges,"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2603373/Cops-fatally-shoot-86-year-old-Queens-resident-shot-own.html

Police said Tozzi, fired one round from a high powered rifle, which went through the metal door where the officer had been standing a moment before. The shooter than barricaded himself in his apartment and fired at least eight more rounds at officers, striking three police vehicles, which were being used as shields by the officers. Tozzi was eventually struck in the chest by a police officer when he approached a back window.

When NYPD arrived, the man banged on the patrol car with the blade. Before they exit, he flings a bottle at a taxi. The cops got out of the car and split up to approach Dasrath, whom a source said weighed about 300 pounds. The cop fired on the man from a distance of about five or six feet. An NYPD press release said Dasrath was shot in the chest and one of his hands, but a cop source said he had five bullet wounds, though some may have been exit wounds. Dasrath, who was said to have had learning disabilities, was taken to Woodhull Hospital, where he died.",Unknown,No Known

One of the students placed a 911 call to report the robbery. Numerous members of the Nassau County Police Department responded to the location. Police Officer Nikolas Budimlic was one of the first officers to arrive on the scene. As he approached the residence, Andrea Rebello's sister ran out of the front door and indicated that an intruder was upstairs and armed with a gun. Inside the residence, Officer Budimlic was confronted by the intruder. Smith was armed with a gun and was physically restraining Andrea Rebello. Smith ignored numerous commands to drop his weapon. During the confrontation, Officer Budimlic fired eight shots at Smith, killing him.

Both men stopped their vehicles at a red light on Bradford Street. According to the NYPD, that's when the driver of a 2016 Kia EX exited his vehicle -- with a 5-month-old inside -- and punched the officer's head through an open driver's side window. Police said the beating continued despite the officer identifying himself as a member of the NYPD. He then pulled out his gun and shot and killed the driver.","Charged with second-degree murder, Acquitted","Charged,
