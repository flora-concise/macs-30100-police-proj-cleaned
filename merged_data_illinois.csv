Before police arrived, the victim was able to gain entry to the building and allegedly began confronting residents while still holding the chainsaw. Police claim that when they arrived, they attempted to de-escalate the situation but the victim refused to drop the chainsaw. Police deployed a taser which had little effect. An officer then shot the victim, killing him.",Pending Investigation,,"https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2024/12/01/chainsaw-wielding-man-shot-killed-st-charles-assisted-living-facility

The victim reportedly became combative with deputies during his arrest, and he was shocked with a stun gun. He was eventually taken into custody and died.
Judge writes in opinion in Federal lawsuit that deputies tased the victim and restrained him, but he jumped and started to flee. An officer tackled the victim, and they pinned him down with heavier restraint. The victim stopped struggling and allegedly pleaded for water and air. He reportedly had a faint pulse. An ambulance took him to Staunton Community Hospital, where he later died.
An autopsy indicated blunt force injuries. It also noted the taser marks in his back.","Pending investigation/No Known Charges, Federal Civil Rights Lawsuit",No Known Charges,"https://www.kmov.com/news/man-dead-shortly-after-altercation-with-deputies-in-madison-county/article_b5741944-da4e-11e9-88a8-d354ae83c1e3.html

""He was having a mental situation,"" Legrier's mother, Janet Cooksey, told ABC 7. ""Sometimes he will get loud, but not violent."" The officer, who has not yet been identified, fatally shot Legrier seven times, the teen's family said. ""We're thinking the police are going to service us, take him to the hospital,"" Cooksey told the Chicago Tribune. ""They took his life.""

He called out to the man to see what he was doing and the man replied ""You don't want no part of me."" The man had a bag or sack over his shoulder and his hand on his waistband, Camden said, but repeatedly ignored the officer's commands to come down after he identified himself as an officer. The man turned down a gangway and started to walk away, but the officer told him there was no way out of that gangway. The man, in a dark gangway, grabbed his waistband and threatened to kill the officer while continuing to ignore the officer's demands to show his hands. The officer opened fire after the man grabbed his waistband. He died at the scene, and the officer was not injured.","Civil Suit/Family awarded settlement, Cleared by DA",No Known Charges,"http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2013/09/02/off-duty-officer-kills-burglary-suspect-in-lincoln-park/

When dispatch called back, the victim's father (unaware the victim had called) asked to have someone sent to check it out. When police arrived, the victim was in the residence, and police set up several houses away. The victim then reportedly came out of the residence and began walking towards police while holding a knife. Police claim the victim refused several commands before they deployed Taser weapons. As the victim continued to move towards police, an officer shot the victim multiple times, killing him.","Pending Investigation, Civil Suit",,"https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/man-shot-killed-by-police-chicago-northwest-suburbs/

The driver of the car, Mariano Ocon Jr., reportedly got out and ""began exhibiting characteristics of an armed person,"" police said. Ocon's girlfriend and children were inside the vehicle. Ocon allegedly fled, officers pursued, and officers saw a handgun. Officers fired, but it was not immediately certain they hit Ocon. Police and the medical examiner determined that Ocon may have suffered a self-inflicted gunshot wound and a wound to the upper body, which was likely fired by police.

Saint Charles Rd,carol stream,IL,60188,DuPage,Carol Stream Police Department,,Gunshot,"Police received a call regarding a domestic violence incident between the caller and the victim, who shared an apartment. When police arrived, they attempted to contact the victim for almost an hour before the caller let them into the apartment, asking them to get her dog. As officers opened the victim's bedroom door, they claim to have seen the victim make a sudden motion as though pointing or throwing something at an officer; they then shot the victim once, killing him.","DA Declined to Prosecute, Civil suit/Pending",No Known Charges,"https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/02/03/man-fatally-wounded-by-police-following-domestic-related-disturbance-in-suburban-carol-stream-officials-said-dies-in-domestic-related/

Wrana, who was frail and dependent on a cane or walker, was armed with his cane, a 2-foot-long metal shoehorn, and a butcher knife. Five officers responded. Wrana refused to drop the knife. After one taser failed to hit Wrana, officer Craig Taylor fired 5 beanbag rounds from a distance of 6-8 feet. No attempt was made to defuse the situation before firing. After the fifth shot, Wrana dropped the knife but remained standing. The commander on scene knocked him to the floor with a riot shield and cuffed him. Wrana died hours later in a local hospital.Officer Taylor is charged with reckless misconduct. Trial is scheduled for September 15, 2014.","Charged, Acquitted","Charged,
