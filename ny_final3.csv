When NYPD arrived, the man banged on the patrol car with the blade. Before they exit, he flings a bottle at a taxi. The cops got out of the car and split up to approach Dasrath, whom a source said weighed about 300 pounds. The cop fired on the man from a distance of about five or six feet. An NYPD press release said Dasrath was shot in the chest and one of his hands, but a cop source said he had five bullet wounds, though some may have been exit wounds.

According to the NYPD, that's when the driver of a 2016 Kia EX exited his vehicle -- with a 5-month-old inside -- and punched the officer's head through an open driver's side window. Police said the beating continued despite the officer identifying himself as a member of the NYPD. He then pulled out his gun and shot and killed the driver.","Charged with second-degree murder, Acquitted","Charged, Acquitted",http://pix11.com/2016/07/04/off-duty-cop-shoots-motorist-in-brooklyn-road-rage-incident-police-sources/,No,Unarmed/Did Not Have Actual Weapon,No Object,Attack,Not Fleeing,Urban,None/Unknown,,No,119800,27596.0,40.676144,-73.893068,3264.0,5%,38%,0%,2%,0%,1%,54%,"(40.676144, -73.893068)",7,4,2016,"Census Tract 1198, Kings County, New York",326.0,127.0,(X),(X),181.0,97.0,69,57,21.2,16.7,51,49,96,67,29.4,17.7,52,47,161,94,49.4,18.4,78,74,0,11,0.0,8.8,0,11,1836.0,265.0,(X),(X),733.0,209.0,245,102,13.3,5.6,82,47,332,175,18.1,7.6,153,137,720,178,39.2,7.5,318,108,222,86,12.1,5.2,60,47,116,69,6.3,3.9,38,36,124,66,6.8,3.7,40,41,77,49,4.2,2.6,42,33,(X),(X),68.6,7.8,(X),(X),(X),(X),10.9,4.6,(X),(X),466.0,162.0,(X),(X),169.0,82.0,399,157,85.6,14.3,169,82,82,72,17.6,13.7,28,34,256.0,136.0,(X),(X),88.0,76.0,191,99,74.6,28.9,40,40,14,22,5.5,8.3,14,22,741.0,202.0,(X),(X),361.0,159.0,470,151,63.4,15.8,224,99,78,48,10.5,6.6,18,19,373.0,173.0,(X),(X),115.0,58.0,199,89,53.4,16.8,65,50,27,30,7.2,8.1,22,29,465,228,(X),(X),155,117,303,129,65.2,16.2,90,68,24,22,5.2,5.1,10,15,128,127,(X),(X),76,94,78,64,60.9,18.5,32,36,6,11,4.7,10.5,0,11,829,188,(X),(X),339,132,634,156,76.5,11.3,267,96,141,73,17.0,7.8,58,46,15,25,(X),(X),15,25,15,25,100.0,73.6,15,25,"Census Tract 1198, Kings County, New York",986.0,89.0,27596,9847,20.1,8.0,-,**,45.6,9.5,31585,7255,1.5,2.5,-,**,1.4,2.2,-,**,0.0,3.0,-,**,31.3,9.9,20707,11478,0.0,3.0,-,**,54.6,9.0,22794,17738,1.6,2.7,-,**,3.9,4.4,-,**,40.6,12.1,27500,9004,38.7,11.8,48200,33981,16.8,8.6,-,**,635.0,127.0,28656,8007,67.1,12.3,29625,5825,32.9,12.3,-,**,27.1,12.0,-,**,46.6,14.8,18167,7612,26.3,12.8,30066,29272,351.0,112.0,18281,17852,60.4,16.5,9000,7006,55.0,15.9,8604,4917,5.4,6.5,-,**,39.6,16.5,31193,10422,34.5,16.3,30170,11258,5.1,8.1,-,**,53.7,(X),(X),(X),52.0,(X),(X),(X),56.7,(X),(X),(X)
